# BroccoliInvitationApp
Broccoli & Co., an upcoming online service company, would like to let people "Request an invitation" on their app. 
Create a simple yet clean app for them that allows users to enter their name and email to receive email invitations to the service. (The service is in closed beta and Broccoli & Co. only want to grant beta access to the service to people who have requested an invite). 
If a user has already requested an invitation, the page should say they are already registered and allow them to cancel the invitation.
